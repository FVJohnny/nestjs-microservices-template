1. Install Docker Desktop for Windows: https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop

2. Install Git for Windows if you donâ€™t have it: https://git-scm.com/download/win

3. Tell npm to use Bash for scripts so npm run dev works as-is:

    Per-project:
        npm config set script-shell "C:\Program Files\Git\bin\bash.exe" --location=project

    Per-user:
        npm config set script-shell "C:\Program Files\Git\bin\bash.exe" --location=user

4. Try running npm run dev.   If it doesn't work, check where Bash is installed with:
where bash

5. Then, run the previous command with the correct path to bash.exe
